# SSA5045-Enhancing-the-Northern-Cross-Radio-Telescope-for-Fast-Radio-Burst-Searching
This is a collection of all the scripts which were created and used during my Masters' Dissertation Project entitled "Enhancing the Northern Cross Radio Telescope for Fast Radio Burst Searching".

This repository contains a toolkit I used to run Heimdall over simulated FRB filterbanks, collate and score the detections against benchmarks, and then visualise and statistically compare parameter combinations.
